In cruise at FL370, [we] began to encounter moderate turbulence. Then encountered an area of severe turbulence and wind shear. Airspeed rapidly increased (not reaching zipper) then rapidly decreased approximately 15 knots into the hook. Full power was applied as the aircraft began to buffet. Aircraft entered an uncommanded descent as well. Autopilot was disconnected and full power applied. Nose down pitch was initiated in order to recover from the buffet condition. Aircraft was recovered normally with an altitude loss of approximately 500 feet. 

On final approach, aircraft started a violent uncommanded right roll. The autopilot disengaged and we got an "autopilot fail" caution message. Captain and First Officer both grabbed the controls before the Captain called "My aircraft". Captain reestablished control and hit the auto pilot disconnect to silence the alarm. With the aircraft under control and well above 1,000 feet, Captain continued the approach by hand, staying above glide path on approach. [We] asked ATC if were following a heavy. ATC confirmed we were 7 miles in trail of a B777. Sudden right roll detective by outside reference and instrument scan. Autopilot disconnecting by master warning and autopilot aural warning. Wake turbulence from a B777 7 miles ahead. Regained manual control and stayed high of glide slope to avoided further wake encounters. ATC should have warned us we were following a heavy. Also ATC and the other aircraft were conversing in French so we were not even aware of a heavy on freq. All aircraft and ATC conversing in one language would have reduced the possibility of this happening.
